# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user inputs.  Specifically, this example shows a route that retrieves a user by ID but fails to handle cases where the provided ID is not a valid number.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug
The original code attempts to parse the user ID as an integer without any validation or error handling. If the ID is not a number, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, leading to a potential crash or unexpected behavior in the `users.find()` method.

## Solution
The solution involves adding explicit checks to ensure the user ID is a valid number before attempting to parse it and use it in the `users.find` operation.  Appropriate error responses are also returned to the client when the ID is invalid or the user is not found.
